Project: Human Emotion Classification
Project describtion: 
	We want to use Data Mining to build a Human Emotion Classifier. 
	The project is divided into four parts
		1) Store the data in database. (Data point: images from CK++)
		2) Use data points to generate features for each picture.
		3) Train classifier (Unsupervise learning)
		4) Testing
		5) Visualization 
Data base: CK++
Language: python 3.6
After the discussion with professor, we decide to use tensorflow to develop our program. And if we use tensorflow, we may do not need the step about feature extraction. We will also learn about sklearner to find whether it will help us about the feature prepeocessing
In order to test our program, we will also use another two method to train it. We plan to build a random forest model and SVM model and compare the result with the deep neural network we build.
